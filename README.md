# hermes-claude-auth
Claude Code OAuth bypass for hermes-agent, use your Claude Code subscription (Max/Pro) with Hermes.

## What this does
Patches hermes-agent at runtime to pass Anthropic's server-side OAuth content validation. It does not modify hermes-agent source files. Installation happens through a Python import hook that monkey-patches `build_anthropic_kwargs` on startup.

## Why this exists
On 2026-04-04, Anthropic added server-side validation that rejects OAuth requests from third-party tools. This patch adds the billing header signature and system prompt structure the API expects.

## Prerequisites
- hermes-agent installed (`~/.hermes/hermes-agent/`)
- Claude Code CLI authenticated (valid credentials at `~/.claude/.credentials.json`)
- hermes-agent configured for OAuth (`credential_pool` has a `claude_code` entry in `~/.hermes/auth.json`)
- Python 3.11+

## Install
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kristianvast/hermes-claude-auth/main/install-remote.sh | bash
```

Or clone manually:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kristianvast/hermes-claude-auth.git
cd hermes-claude-auth
./install.sh
```

What `install.sh` does:
- Copies `anthropic_billing_bypass.py` to `~/.hermes/patches/`
- Installs a `.pth` shim + bootstrap module into the hermes venv's site-packages (this loads the hook at interpreter startup; see "How it works" below for why a `.pth` and not `sitecustomize.py`)
- Restarts `hermes-gateway.service` if running

## Uninstall
```bash
./uninstall.sh          # remove hook only
./uninstall.sh --purge  # remove hook + patch file
```

## How it works
1. **Billing header**: SHA-256 signed `x-anthropic-billing-header` injected as `system[0]`
2. **System prompt relocation**: Non-identity system entries moved to the first user message as `<system-reminder>` blocks
3. **Beta flags**: Adds `prompt-caching-scope-2026-01-05` and `advisor-tool-2026-03-01`
4. **Stainless SDK spoof**: Lowercase `x-stainless-*` headers + `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access` + `?beta=true` query param matching real Claude Code 2.1.112
5. **Tool name namespacing**: Hermes's `mcp_bash` is rewritten to `mcp__hermes__Bash` outbound; the response normalizer unwraps it back to `bash` so hermes's tool dispatcher resolves the registered name without auto-repair noise
6. **Tool pair repair**: Orphaned `tool_use` / `tool_result` blocks (left by long conversations or partial summaries) are stripped before signing — prevents HTTP 400 (upstream PR #136)
7. **Haiku effort stripping**: `effort` parameter is removed for haiku models that reject it with HTTP 400 (upstream PR #126)
8. **Temperature fix**: Strips non-default `temperature` on Opus 4.6 adaptive thinking, which otherwise rejects with HTTP 400
9. **Account metadata**: Maps `~/.claude.json::oauthAccount.accountUuid` to `metadata.user_id` (Anthropic rejected the older `account_uuid` key with HTTP 400 on 2026-04-29)

Installed through a `.pth` file in the venv's site-packages that imports a small bootstrap module at interpreter startup, which in turn registers a `MetaPathFinder` hook for `agent.anthropic_adapter`. No source modifications.

The `.pth` shim runs *before* `site.py` imports `sitecustomize`, on every platform. An earlier version of this installer wrote a `sitecustomize.py` into site-packages directly, which failed silently on Debian/Ubuntu — those distros ship `/usr/lib/pythonX.Y/sitecustomize.py` for apport and it wins import priority over the venv-local one, so the bypass hook never ran. The current installer auto-migrates legacy installs.

## What gets modified
| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `~/.hermes/patches/anthropic_billing_bypass.py` | Created |
| `<venv>/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/hermes_claude_auth.pth` | Created |
| `<venv>/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/_hermes_claude_auth_bootstrap.py` | Created |
| `<venv>/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/sitecustomize.py` | Removed if left behind by a legacy install (original restored from `.pre-hermes-claude-auth` backup when present) |
| hermes-agent source files | NOT modified |

## Compatibility
- Tested with hermes-agent on Python 3.11+
- Linux and macOS
- Depends on `build_anthropic_kwargs(is_oauth=...)` in `agent.anthropic_adapter`, so it may need updating if hermes-agent changes that interface

## Troubleshooting

### Install issues
- **"hermes-agent not found"**: Make sure Hermes is installed at `~/.hermes/hermes-agent/`
- **"No virtualenv found"**: Set `HERMES_VENV` to point to your venv
- **Patch not loading**: Check `journalctl --user -u hermes-gateway -n 50` for `[anthropic_billing_bypass]` or `[hermes-claude-auth]` messages
- **Bypass silently inactive on Debian/Ubuntu** (legacy `sitecustomize.py` installs only): If you installed before the `.pth` migration, the bypass may never have actually run on your host. Debian/Ubuntu ship `/usr/lib/pythonX.Y/sitecustomize.py` for apport, and that one wins import priority over the venv-local `sitecustomize.py`, so the hook never installs. Quick diagnostic:

  ```bash
  cd ~/.hermes/hermes-agent && ./venv/bin/python -c "import anthropic_billing_bypass"
  ```

  `ModuleNotFoundError` means the hook isn't running. Fix is to re-run `./install.sh` — the current installer uses a `.pth` shim that sidesteps the apport collision and auto-migrates legacy installs.

### Auth issues

- **`Anthropic 401 authentication failed`** or **`No Anthropic credentials found`**: Hermes reads Claude subscription credentials from `~/.claude/.credentials.json`. If Claude Code is authenticated (e.g. in macOS Keychain) but that file is missing or stale, Hermes fails even when Claude Code itself works.

  On macOS, `install.sh` v1.1.1+ auto-mirrors the `Claude Code-credentials` Keychain entry into `~/.claude/.credentials.json` on every run, so re-running the installer is usually enough. Full fix:

  1. Refresh Claude subscription login:
     ```bash
     claude auth login --claudeai
     ```
  2. Re-run the installer to re-mirror credentials (macOS) and reload the patch:
     ```bash
     ./install.sh
     ```
  3. Remove stale `ANTHROPIC_TOKEN` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` values from `~/.hermes/.env` — they can override subscription auth.
  4. Reset cached credentials:
     ```bash
     hermes auth reset anthropic
     ```
  5. Retry with a smoke test:
     ```bash
     hermes chat -q 'Reply with exactly: AUTH TEST OK' --provider anthropic -m claude-sonnet-4-6 -Q
     ```

  If the auto-mirror doesn't work (e.g. your Keychain entry is under a different service name), mirror it manually:
  ```bash
  python3 - <<'PY'
  import subprocess
  from pathlib import Path

  secret = subprocess.check_output(
      ['security', 'find-generic-password', '-s', 'Claude Code-credentials', '-w'],
      text=True,
  ).strip()

  cred_path = Path.home() / '.claude' / '.credentials.json'
  cred_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
  cred_path.write_text(secret)
  cred_path.chmod(0o600)
  print(f'wrote {cred_path}')
  PY
  ```

  Credit: the macOS Keychain mirror approach was written up by [@DrQbz](https://github.com/DrQbz) in [issue #5](https://github.com/kristianvast/hermes-claude-auth/issues/5) and is now automated in `install.sh`.

### Billing / routing issues

- **HTTP 400: "Third-party apps now draw from your extra usage, not your plan limits"**: Anthropic's server-side validation has classified your requests as third-party and routed them to pay-per-token credits instead of your Max/Pro plan. Make sure you're on the latest version of this patch (it tracks the upstream [opencode-claude-auth](https://github.com/griffinmartin/opencode-claude-auth) fingerprint changes). Reinstall with `./install.sh` and restart `hermes-gateway`. If the error persists after update, the bypass is currently broken upstream too — track [issue #6](https://github.com/kristianvast/hermes-claude-auth/issues/6) for status.
- **HTTP 400 persists after update**: The billing salt or signature format may have been rotated by Anthropic again. Check for newer commits to this repo.
