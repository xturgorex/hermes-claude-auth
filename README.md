# hermes-claude-auth
Claude Code OAuth bypass for hermes-agent, use your Claude Code subscription (Max/Pro) with Hermes.

## What this does
Patches hermes-agent at runtime to pass Anthropic's server-side OAuth content validation. It does not modify hermes-agent source files. Installation happens through a Python import hook that monkey-patches `build_anthropic_kwargs` on startup.

## Why this exists
On 2026-04-04, Anthropic added server-side validation that rejects OAuth requests from third-party tools. This patch adds the billing header signature and system prompt structure the API expects.

## Prerequisites
- hermes-agent installed (`$HERMES_HOME/hermes-agent/`, defaults to `~/.hermes/hermes-agent/` on Linux/macOS and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\hermes-agent\` on Windows)
- Claude Code CLI authenticated (valid credentials at `~/.claude/.credentials.json`)
- hermes-agent configured for OAuth (`credential_pool` has a `claude_code` entry in `$HERMES_HOME/auth.json`)
- Python 3.11+
- **Windows**: PowerShell 5.1+ and Git in PATH

## Install

### Linux / macOS
```bash
# Remote install (one-liner)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kristianvast/hermes-claude-auth/main/install-remote.sh | bash

# Or clone manually
git clone https://github.com/kristianvast/hermes-claude-auth.git
cd hermes-claude-auth
./install.sh
```

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kristianvast/hermes-claude-auth/main/install-remote.ps1 | iex
```

Or clone manually:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/kristianvast/hermes-claude-auth.git
cd hermes-claude-auth
.\install.ps1
```

What the installer does:
- Auto-detects your hermes directory (`$HERMES_HOME` if set, else `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\` on Windows and `~/.hermes/` on Linux/macOS)
- Copies `anthropic_billing_bypass.py` to `<hermes-dir>/patches/`
- Installs a `.pth` shim + bootstrap module into the hermes venv's site-packages (this loads the hook at interpreter startup; see "How it works" below for why a `.pth` and not `sitecustomize.py`)
- Mirrors Claude Code credentials from the OS credential store to `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager)
- Restarts `hermes-gateway.service` if running (Linux only)

## Agent Handoff Prompt

Use this prompt when another Hermes instance needs to install, repair, or audit
Claude auth without losing the Antigravity provider:

```text
You are setting up hermes-claude-auth on this machine.

Work from the persistent clone at ~/hermes-claude-auth. If it exists and is
clean, run `git pull`; if it has local changes, do not overwrite them and
report that pull was skipped. If it does not exist, run:
`git clone https://github.com/kristianvast/hermes-claude-auth.git ~/hermes-claude-auth`

Then run:
`cd ~/hermes-claude-auth && ./install.sh`

After install, verify and report:
- `./install.sh --check` passes.
- `~/.hermes/patches/anthropic_billing_bypass.py` matches this repo.
- The Hermes venv `sitecustomize.py` contains `# hermes-claude-auth managed`.
- If `# hermes-antigravity managed` is also present, confirm the shared hook
  still contains Antigravity hooks for `hermes_cli.auth`,
  `hermes_cli.providers`, `hermes_cli.commands`, `cli`,
  `agent.auxiliary_client`, `hermes_cli.runtime_provider`,
  `hermes_cli.main`, `hermes_cli.model_switch`, and `api.config`.
- Importing `agent.error_classifier` in the Hermes venv does not print a
  `ModuleNotFoundError` traceback for `anthropic_billing_bypass`.
- `~/.hermes/hermes-agent/.git/hooks/post-merge` exists and is executable.

If Claude credentials are available, smoke-test:
`hermes chat --provider anthropic -m claude-sonnet-4-6 -q "OK" -Q`

If Antigravity is also installed and credentials are available, smoke-test:
`hermes chat --provider google-antigravity -m gemini-3.5-flash-high -q "OK" -Q`

If any smoke test cannot be run, say exactly what blocked it. Finish with the
current git commit, whether automatic repair is installed, and the check/smoke
results.
```

## Uninstall

### Linux / macOS
```bash
./uninstall.sh          # remove hook only
./uninstall.sh --purge  # remove hook + patch file
```

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
.\uninstall.ps1          # remove hook only
.\uninstall.ps1 -Purge   # remove hook + patch file
```

## Surviving `hermes update` (auto-recovery)

`hermes update` can wipe the loader from the venv's `site-packages/` in two
ways:

1. **`git merge` / `git checkout`** of the hermes-agent repo — triggers git
   hooks, but the default `.git/hooks/` dir is *inside* the repo and gets
   **stashed** by the update's `git stash` step, so hooks there don't fire at
   the right time.
2. **Venv rebuild** — the update provisions a fresh Python runtime, which
   deletes `sitecustomize.py` outright. No git hook covers this.

### Two-layer defense

**Layer 1 — git hooks via `core.hooksPath` (outside the repo):**

```bash
# From inside your hermes-agent checkout:
mkdir -p "$LOCALAPPDATA/hermes/git-hooks"
cp post-merge.hook.sh "$LOCALAPPDATA/hermes/git-hooks/post-merge"
cp post-checkout.hook.sh "$LOCALAPPDATA/hermes/git-hooks/post-checkout"
chmod +x "$LOCALAPPDATA/hermes/git-hooks/post-"*
git config core.hooksPath "$LOCALAPPDATA/hermes/git-hooks"
```

Because the hooks live *outside* `.git/hooks/`, the update's `git stash`
can't touch them, and `core.hooksPath` makes git use them for every
merge/checkout.

**Layer 2 — watchdog cron (covers venv rebuild):**

```bash
# Hermes cron runs restore_loader.sh every 15m; it re-copies the loader
# from $LOCALAPPDATA/hermes/patches/sitecustomize.py if it's missing.
hermes cron create "every 15m" --name restore-claude-auth-loader \
  --no-agent --script restore_loader.sh --deliver local
```

The cron job only fires while the Hermes gateway is running — after an update,
the loader is restored within ≤15 minutes of the gateway coming back up.

Both layers are idempotent and never break the update. The canonical loader
lives at `$LOCALAPPDATA/hermes/patches/sitecustomize.py` (outside any repo).

> **Windows note:** hooks are POSIX shell scripts run under Git Bash (ships
> with Git for Windows). The cron script uses `uname` to resolve paths and
> works under the Hermes gateway's environment.

## How it works
1. **Billing header**: SHA-256 signed `x-anthropic-billing-header` injected as `system[0]`
2. **System prompt relocation**: Non-identity system entries moved to the first user message as `<system-reminder>` blocks
3. **Beta flags**: Adds `prompt-caching-scope-2026-01-05` and `advisor-tool-2026-03-01`
4. **Stainless SDK spoof**: Lowercase `x-stainless-*` headers + `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access` + `?beta=true` query param matching real Claude Code 2.1.112
5. **Tool name namespacing**: Hermes's `mcp_bash` is rewritten to `mcp__hermes__Bash` outbound; the response normalizer unwraps it back to `bash` so hermes's tool dispatcher resolves the registered name without auto-repair noise
6. **Tool pair repair**: Orphaned `tool_use` / `tool_result` blocks (left by long conversations or partial summaries) are stripped before signing — prevents HTTP 400 (upstream PR #136)
7. **Haiku effort stripping**: `effort` parameter is removed for haiku models that reject it with HTTP 400 (upstream PR #126)
8. **Temperature fix**: Strips non-default `temperature` on Opus 4.6 adaptive thinking, which otherwise rejects with HTTP 400
9. **Account metadata**: Maps `~/.claude.json::oauthAccount.accountUuid` to `metadata.user_id` (Anthropic rejected the older `account_uuid` key with HTTP 400 on 2026-04-29)
10. **Window-aware rate-limit auto-wait** (v1.5.9+): when Anthropic returns HTTP 429 mid-agent, reads the `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-{5h,1d,7d}-status` / `-reset` headers to identify which subscription window tripped, picks the **longest** waiting window (sleeping through a 7d reset also clears 5h), and applies a **per-window** safety cap (`HERMES_RL_AUTOWAIT_MAX_5H_S`=6h, `_1D_S`=26h, `_7D_S`=7.5d). The legacy 6h cap is kept as the fallback when no window-specific status is present. Per-window caps can be tuned via env vars.

Installed through a `.pth` file in the venv's site-packages that imports a small bootstrap module at interpreter startup, which in turn registers a `MetaPathFinder` hook for `agent.anthropic_adapter`. No source modifications.

The `.pth` shim runs *before* `site.py` imports `sitecustomize`, on every platform. An earlier version of this installer wrote a `sitecustomize.py` into site-packages directly, which failed silently on Debian/Ubuntu — those distros ship `/usr/lib/pythonX.Y/sitecustomize.py` for apport and it wins import priority over the venv-local one, so the bypass hook never ran. The current installer auto-migrates legacy installs.

## Subscription rate-limit auto-wait (Claude Pro/Max windows: 5h, 1d, 7d)

When a long agent run exhausts a Claude Pro/Max usage window mid-flight,
api.anthropic.com returns HTTP 429 with a reset time in the
`anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*-reset` headers.  Hermes core's retry loop
caps backoff at 120s and abandons the run, surfacing "rate-limiting
requests" on Telegram and killing the session.

This patch wraps the two API-call entry points on `run_agent.AIAgent` so a
genuine subscription-window 429 instead **sleeps until the window resets**
(interruptibly, in short chunks) and then retries the same call transparently.
It picks the **longest** throttled window (e.g. a 7d hit also clears the 5h
window, so a single sleep covers both) and applies a **per-window** safety
cap (5h=6h, 1d=26h, 7d=7.5d). Behaviour is tunable via env vars:

| Env var | Default | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `HERMES_RL_AUTOWAIT` | `1` | `0` disables auto-wait entirely |
| `HERMES_RL_AUTOWAIT_MAX_S` | `21600` | fallback cap (s) when no window detected |
| `HERMES_RL_AUTOWAIT_MAX_5H_S` | `21600` | 5h-window safety cap (6h) |
| `HERMES_RL_AUTOWAIT_MAX_1D_S` | `93600` | 1d-window safety cap (26h) |
| `HERMES_RL_AUTOWAIT_MAX_7D_S` | `648000` | 7d-window safety cap (7.5d) |
| `HERMES_RL_AUTOWAIT_BUFFER_S` | `5` | pad added after reset |
| `HERMES_RL_AUTOWAIT_DEFAULT_S` | `300` | wait when no reset header found |

The wait loop also calls `agent._touch_activity(...)` every ~25s so the
gateway's inactivity watchdog doesn't kill the agent mid-wait.  Idempotent
and never breaks the billing path: if anything goes wrong, the original
call/exception behaviour is preserved.

Ported from kristianvast/hermes-claude-auth PR #27 (window-aware auto-wait);
the fingerprint parity fix below from PR #21.

## Fingerprint parity (avoids "extra usage" billing)

Anthropic's validator cross-references the `user-agent` header and the
`cc_version=` field in the billing header.  If the SDK client sends
`claude-cli/<ver> (external, cli)` while the billing header claims
`cc_entrypoint=sdk-cli`, the request is flagged as third-party and routed to
pay-per-token **extra usage** instead of your Max/Pro plan
(`HTTP 400 You're out of extra usage`).  This patch pins the Claude Code
version to `2.1.112` for **both** the user-agent and the signed billing
header, and forces `x-app: cli`, eliminating the drift that triggered
upstream issue #6.

| `$HERMES_HOME/patches/anthropic_billing_bypass.py` | Created |
| `<venv>/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/hermes_claude_auth.pth` (Linux/macOS)<br>`<venv>\Lib\site-packages\hermes_claude_auth.pth` (Windows) | Created |

| hermes-agent source files | NOT modified |

## After Hermes Update

When you run `hermes update` (which does `git pull` + `pip install`), the
`sitecustomize.py` inside the venv may be overwritten. The patch file survives.

**Automatic recovery (default).** `install.sh` installs a git `post-merge` hook
into `~/.hermes/hermes-agent/.git/hooks/`, so the moment `hermes update` runs its
`git pull`, the hook detects the missing hook and re-runs recovery automatically.
If the Google Antigravity plugin is also installed, its coexistence
`sitecustomize.py` (which already contains the Claude hook) is restored first and
this installer leaves it untouched — the two patches never clobber each other.

> **Keep the clone in a persistent path** (e.g. `~/hermes-claude-auth`), **not
> `/tmp`**. The post-merge hook looks for the installer at
> `$HOME/hermes-claude-auth/install.sh` first; a `/tmp` clone is wiped on reboot
> and auto-recovery silently can't run.

**Check what's broken** (verifies files exist AND match the repo byte-for-byte):
```bash
cd ~/hermes-claude-auth
./install.sh --check
```
`--check` flags **content drift** too — if the installed
`anthropic_billing_bypass.py` differs from the repo (e.g. a hot-fix was applied
to one but not synced to the other), it reports `[!] DRIFT` so you can sync the
newer copy back before a clean install silently reverts it. The shared
`sitecustomize.py` is intentionally not compared (it legitimately differs when
the Antigravity plugin's multi-hook version is installed).

**Recover (only restores sitecustomize.py + patch):**
```bash
cd ~/hermes-claude-auth
git pull && ./install.sh --post-update
```

**Full recovery:**
```bash
cd ~/hermes-claude-auth
git pull && ./install.sh
```

### What survives `hermes update`

| File | Location | Survives? |
|------|----------|:---:|
| `anthropic_billing_bypass.py` | `~/.hermes/patches/` | ✅ Outside repo |
| **`sitecustomize.py`** | venv `site-packages/` | ❌ Overwritten |
| Claude credentials | `~/.claude/` | ✅ Managed by Claude CLI |
| Auth token | `~/.hermes/auth.json` | ✅ Outside repo |

Only `sitecustomize.py` needs recovery. `--post-update` does exactly that.

## Compatibility
- Tested with hermes-agent on Python 3.11+
- Linux, macOS, and **Windows** (native: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes`; the bypass
  patch lives at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\patches\anthropic_billing_bypass.py`)
- **Multiple profiles**: Hermes supports `profiles/<name>/` under the data
  root. The patch is installed once at the data root and shared by every
  profile; `HERMES_HOME` may point at a profile dir and the loader still
  resolves the patch correctly.
- Depends on `build_anthropic_kwargs(is_oauth=...)` in `agent.anthropic_adapter`, so it may need updating if hermes-agent changes that interface

## Verifying the bypass is active (not falling back to extra usage)

After install, confirm Hermes is using the subscription path and not silently
billing pay-per-token:

1. **Startup log** — look for these lines in the Hermes gateway log
   (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\logs\` on Windows):
   ```
   [anthropic_billing_bypass] Bypass installed
   [anthropic_billing_bypass] Transport unwrap hook installed
   [anthropic_billing_bypass] Rate-limit auto-wait installed
   ```
2. **No `extra usage` errors** — if you see `HTTP 400 You're out of extra
   usage` or `HTTP 429 ... extra usage required`, the fingerprint drifted and
   the request was routed to the pay-per-token bucket. Re-run `install.sh`.
3. **Token flow** — calls should succeed with `provider=anthropic` in
   `agent.log` and normal in/out token counts (not 429s).

> **Dynamic version detection:** This build detects the installed Claude Code
> version automatically (via `claude --version`) and uses it for both the
> user-agent and the signed billing header. No manual pinning — when you
> update Claude Code, the bypass follows on the next Hermes start. Falls back
> to `_PINNED_CC_VERSION` (`2.1.112`) only if Claude Code isn't on PATH.
> This replaces the static pin from upstream PR #21 and removes the drift that
> triggered issue #6.

## Integrated community PRs

This build merges the open community PRs into one coherent tree. Where two PRs
solved the same problem differently, the newer/better-reasoned design won and
the other was folded in or dropped:

- **PR #16** — loader moved from `sitecustomize.py` to a `.pth` shim +
  bootstrap module, fixing installs that were silently dead on Debian/Ubuntu
  (the system apport `sitecustomize.py` wins import priority).
- **PR #28** — patch resolution across Hermes profiles, `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, and
  `$HERMES_HOME`, plus dynamic Claude Code version detection and the two-layer
  auto-recovery (`core.hooksPath` hooks + `restore_loader.sh` cron).
- **PR #26** — `$HERMES_HOME` honoured throughout the shell installers.
- **PR #24** — Windows PowerShell installers + Credential Manager mirroring,
  retargeted onto the `.pth` mechanism. Supersedes PR #17.
- **PR #21** — fingerprint parity (forced `user-agent`, `x-app`). Its
  multi-interpreter install was ported onto the `.pth` mechanism so the hook
  also lands in an editable install used by the CLI.
- **PR #23** — thinking-block replay integrity, tool-pair repair hardening, and
  the `agent.error_classifier` hook. Its installer rewrite (`--check`,
  `.git/hooks/post-merge`) was dropped in favour of PR #28's recovery model,
  which deliberately avoids `.git/hooks` because `hermes update` stashes it.
- **PR #20** — per-pool-entry `account_uuid` billing routing for multi-account
  credential pools.
- **PR #1** — clone URL fix.

Not merged:

- **PR #17** — strict subset of PR #24.
- **PR #7** — MD5 tool-name obfuscation. Upstream never adopted it and still
  ships PascalCase `mcp_Bash`; this tree keeps the namespaced PascalCase scheme.
- **PR #10** — stale fingerprint base (branched before v1.5.0) and conflicting.

## Troubleshooting

### Install issues
- **"hermes-agent not found"**: Make sure Hermes is installed at `$HERMES_HOME/hermes-agent/` (defaults to `~/.hermes/hermes-agent/`) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\hermes-agent\` (Windows)
- **"No virtualenv found"**: Set `HERMES_VENV` to point to your venv
- **"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'anthropic_billing_bypass'"** on every startup: the hook couldn't find the patch. This happens when `HERMES_HOME` points at a **profile** directory (`.../hermes/profiles/<name>`) but the patch lives at the data root. The bootstrap resolves that case automatically — re-run `./install.sh` to pick it up.
- **Patch not loading**: Check `journalctl --user -u hermes-gateway -n 50` (Linux) or the Hermes log under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\logs\` (Windows) for `[anthropic_billing_bypass]` or `[hermes-claude-auth]` messages
- **Bypass silently inactive on Debian/Ubuntu** (legacy `sitecustomize.py` installs only): If you installed before the `.pth` migration, the bypass may never have actually run on your host. Debian/Ubuntu ship `/usr/lib/pythonX.Y/sitecustomize.py` for apport, and that one wins import priority over the venv-local `sitecustomize.py`, so the hook never installs. Quick diagnostic:

  ```bash
  cd ~/.hermes/hermes-agent && ./venv/bin/python -c "import anthropic_billing_bypass"
  ```

  `ModuleNotFoundError` means the hook isn't running. Fix is to re-run `./install.sh` — the current installer uses a `.pth` shim that sidesteps the apport collision and auto-migrates legacy installs.
- **PowerShell execution policy**: The remote installer (`irm | iex`) handles this automatically. For manual runs, use `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1`

### Auth issues

- **`Anthropic 401 authentication failed`** or **`No Anthropic credentials found`**: Hermes reads Claude subscription credentials from `~/.claude/.credentials.json`. If Claude Code is authenticated (e.g. in macOS Keychain) but that file is missing or stale, Hermes fails even when Claude Code itself works.

  On macOS, `install.sh` v1.1.1+ auto-mirrors the `Claude Code-credentials` Keychain entry into `~/.claude/.credentials.json` on every run, so re-running the installer is usually enough. Full fix:

  1. Refresh Claude subscription login:
     ```bash
     claude auth login --claudeai
     ```
  2. Re-run the installer to re-mirror credentials (macOS) and reload the patch:
     ```bash
     ./install.sh
     ```
  3. Remove stale `ANTHROPIC_TOKEN` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` values from `$HERMES_HOME/.env` — they can override subscription auth.
  4. Reset cached credentials:
     ```bash
     hermes auth reset anthropic
     ```
  5. Retry with a smoke test:
     ```bash
     hermes chat -q 'Reply with exactly: AUTH TEST OK' --provider anthropic -m claude-sonnet-4-6 -Q
     ```

  If the auto-mirror doesn't work (e.g. your Keychain entry is under a different service name), mirror it manually:
  ```bash
  python3 - <<'PY'
  import subprocess
  from pathlib import Path

  secret = subprocess.check_output(
      ['security', 'find-generic-password', '-s', 'Claude Code-credentials', '-w'],
      text=True,
  ).strip()

  cred_path = Path.home() / '.claude' / '.credentials.json'
  cred_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
  cred_path.write_text(secret)
  cred_path.chmod(0o600)
  print(f'wrote {cred_path}')
  PY
  ```

  Credit: the macOS Keychain mirror approach was written up by [@DrQbz](https://github.com/DrQbz) in [issue #5](https://github.com/kristianvast/hermes-claude-auth/issues/5) and is now automated in `install.sh`.

  **On Windows**, `install.ps1` auto-mirrors the `Claude Code-credentials` entry from Windows Credential Manager into `~/.claude/.credentials.json` using the Win32 Credential API (analogous to the macOS Keychain mirror). Re-running the installer is usually sufficient:
  ```powershell
  .\install.ps1
  ```
  If auto-mirroring fails (e.g. PowerShell constrained language mode), re-authenticate and retry:
  ```powershell
  claude auth login --claudeai
  .\install.ps1
  ```
  If credentials still aren't found, check Windows Credential Manager manually:
  ```powershell
  # List all Claude-related credentials
  cmdkey /list:*Claude*
  # If no entry exists, re-authenticate:
  claude auth login --claudeai
  ```

### Billing / routing issues

- **HTTP 400: "Third-party apps now draw from your extra usage, not your plan limits"**: Anthropic's server-side validation has classified your requests as third-party and routed them to pay-per-token credits instead of your Max/Pro plan. Make sure you're on the latest version of this patch (it tracks the upstream [opencode-claude-auth](https://github.com/griffinmartin/opencode-claude-auth) fingerprint changes). Reinstall with `./install.sh` and restart `hermes-gateway`. If the error persists after update, the bypass is currently broken upstream too — track [issue #6](https://github.com/kristianvast/hermes-claude-auth/issues/6) for status.
- **HTTP 400 persists after update**: The billing salt or signature format may have been rotated by Anthropic again. Check for newer commits to this repo.

### Rate-limit / 429 behaviour

- **Auto-wait won't kick in / 429 reaches the user immediately**: the patch
  is disabled. Re-enable with `HERMES_RL_AUTOWAIT=1` (the default). It
  requires the `sitecustomize.py` hook to be installed (run `./install.sh`
  and check with `./install.sh --check`).
- **Auto-wait bails with "this is bigger than safety-cap" on a weekly limit**:
  you're on an older build (< v1.5.9). v1.5.9 added window-aware
  detection — it now reads `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-7d-status` /
  `-reset` and waits up to `HERMES_RL_AUTOWAIT_MAX_7D_S` (default 7.5d).
  Upgrade: `cd ~/hermes-claude-auth && git pull && ./install.sh`.
- **Want a shorter / longer wait for a specific window**: tune the
  per-window cap via env vars (values in seconds, units in
  `~/.hermes/.env` or your systemd unit):
  - `HERMES_RL_AUTOWAIT_MAX_5H_S` (default `21600` = 6h)
  - `HERMES_RL_AUTOWAIT_MAX_1D_S` (default `93600` = 26h)
  - `HERMES_RL_AUTOWAIT_MAX_7D_S` (default `648000` = 7.5d)
  - `HERMES_RL_AUTOWAIT_MAX_S` — fallback when the 429 has no
    window-specific status header (default `21600` = 6h).
  Setting any of the `MAX_*_S` vars to a value `<= 0` falls back to the
  default; to *disable* auto-wait entirely, use `HERMES_RL_AUTOWAIT=0`.
